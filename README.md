## Getting Started

In your terminal, you can run:

### `git clone https://github.com/13illydakid/qa-wolf-take-home.git`

"cd" into the project directory and open it with your preferred code editor.
If your preferred editor is VS Code, the command would be "code ."

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

This will install project dependencies.

### `npm start`

This will run the index.js file with node. A file named "hackernews_top10.csv" has now been created and contains the subsequent data.
